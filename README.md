# Structuring NPS Survey Data With LLMs
This project implements advanced data pipelines to harness the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to unlock meaningful insights from open-ended survey responses. These insights are currently empowering park superintendents across the nation with actionable information to make data-driven decisions. This project has been a cornerstone in the National Park Service's (NPS) efforts to modernize social science research and has been instrumental in shaping the future of the Socioeconomic Monitoring (SEM) program.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is deployed within the National Park Service (NPS) and is currently in use by parks across the nation. A less detailed version of this project is in the process of being released to the public directly through the NPS website and will be available soon. Due to the sensitive nature of the data, a release of the full dashboard is not available, however screenshots are provided below.

# Motivation
Open-ended survey responses are a valuable source of information that lets respondents express their thoughts and feelings in a more nuanced way than multiple-choice questions. However, this means the data is unstructured and is impossible to analyze using traditional methods. This project aims to leverage the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract underlying geometric patterns from the textual responses, providing clusters of semantic similarity that can be used to drive informed decision-making.

# :sparkles: Innovative Emphasis
**I designed this project with the end-user in mind. Whether it be a park superintendent, a well tenured statistician, or the American public, I wanted to ensure that the insights generated from this project were accessible and actionable. While NLP techniques are powerful, they can yield complex results that are difficult to interpret. To address this, I wrapped the NLP pipeline in a user-friendly Power BI dashboard that allows users to interact with the data in a meaningful way.**
